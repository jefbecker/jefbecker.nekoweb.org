This is the public repository of [the copy of my personal website](https://jefbecker.nekoweb.org), it is hosted on [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org). I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) integrated to Github to make pull requests. I tried to use [Nekoweb-Deploy](https://github.com/mp-pinheiro/nekoweb-deploy), but I could not make it work.
